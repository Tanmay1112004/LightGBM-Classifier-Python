# 🚀 LightGBM Classifier in Python

A complete, end-to-end implementation of **LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)** for classification tasks using Python.

This project walks through the full ML lifecycle — from **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to **model optimization and evaluation** — making it a practical reference for students, data science enthusiasts, and professionals.
