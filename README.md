## 📌 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Preprocessing and train-test split  
- LightGBM intuition and comparison with XGBoost  
- Model training with default and tuned parameters  
- Hyperparameter tuning for controlling overfitting  
- Feature importance visualization  
- Performance evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, etc.)
